## Learn [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
### Getting Started
Let’s start your Rust journey! There’s a lot to learn, but every journey starts somewhere. In this chapter, we’ll discuss:
- Installing Rust on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- Writing a program that prints `Hello, world!`
- Using `cargo`, Rust’s package manager and build system
### Installation
The first step is to install Rust. We’ll download Rust through `rustup`, a command line tool for managing Rust versions and associated tools. You’ll need an internet connection for the download.
> Note: If you prefer not to use `rustup` for some reason, please see the Other Rust Installation Methods page for more options.
